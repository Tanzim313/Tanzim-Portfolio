      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">As Salamualaikum, I am Tanzim, currently studying Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the International Islamic University Chattogram (IIUC).
My coding journey began in 2023 with my very first "Hello World" program in C. Since then, I have been learning multiple programming languages including C, C++, Python, and JavaScript, along with frameworks and tools like Django, React.js, and Tailwind CSS,git.
In 2024, I started developing projects using Python and Django as part of my university software development courses, building several projects such as e-commerce platforms and student management systems. Later, in 2025, I began learning JavaScript and React.js, creating projects like a Blood Donation platform and ServeOn, a local service application.
I truly enjoy programming and problem-solving. I have solved over 200 problems on Codeforces and continuously challenge myself to improve my skills. Currently, I am learning AI with the goal of becoming a Full Stack AI Engineer.
Outside of programming, I am passionate about cycling and exploring new technologies. I enjoy building meaningful projects that can make a positive impact.
